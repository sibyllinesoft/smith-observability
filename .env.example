# Copy this file to `.env` and provide secrets before running `docker compose up`.
# These values are consumed by the Claude Code container (and forwarded into
# Bifrost) so the stack can proxy Anthropic-compatible traffic through
# OpenRouter by default.

# Required: OpenRouter API key used by Bifrost and the Claude CLI. Without this
# the CLI will exit with "Invalid API key" and no requests will reach OpenRouter.
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=

# Optional: If you want to override the default demo model just set the same key
# that Claude Code expects. This is usually not needed because the entrypoint
# mirrors OPENROUTER_API_KEY into these variables automatically.
# CLAUDE_API_KEY=
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=

# Optional: OpenAI key used when running `npm run codex` (Codex CLI). Without
# this the CLI cannot call the OpenAI API through Bifrost.

# Optional: GitHub token used when the automation asks the CLI to clone private
# repositories. Leave unset if you only operate on public content.

# GIT_ACCESS_TOKEN=

# Optional: turn off the bundled OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation for Bifrost
# if you cannot run the container with elevated privileges.

# Optional: override the gateway and OTEL endpoints when running the Claude CLI
# or Codex outside Docker. The compose stack exposes Bifrost on localhost:6080
# and the OTEL collector on localhost:4318 by default.
