Bifrost's vault support enables seamless integration with enterprise-grade secret management systems, allowing you to connect to existing vaults and automatically sync virtual keys and provider API keys directly onto the Bifrost platform.

## Overview

The vault integration provides:

- **Automated Key Synchronization**: Connect to your existing vault infrastructure and sync all API keys automatically
- **Periodic Key Management**: Regular synchronization ensures deprecated and archived keys are properly managed
- **Multi-Vault Support**: Compatible with HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Google Secret Manager, and Azure Key Vault
- **Zero-Downtime Operations**: Keys are synced without interrupting your running services

## Supported Vault Systems

### HashiCorp Vault

Connect to your HashiCorp Vault instance for centralized secret management.

```json
{
  "vault": {
    "type": "hashicorp",
    "address": "https://vault.company.com:8200",
    "token": "${VAULT_TOKEN}",
    "mount": "secret",
    "sync_interval": "300s"
  }
}
```

### AWS Secrets Manager

Integrate with AWS Secrets Manager for cloud-native secret storage.

```json
{
  "vault": {
    "type": "aws_secrets_manager",
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "access_key_id": "${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}",
    "secret_access_key": "${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}",
    "sync_interval": "300s"
  }
}
```

### Google Secret Manager

Use Google Cloud's Secret Manager for secure key storage.

```json
{
  "vault": {
    "type": "google_secret_manager",
    "project_id": "your-project-id",
    "credentials_file": "/path/to/service-account.json",
    "sync_interval": "300s"
  }
}
```

### Azure Key Vault

Connect to Azure Key Vault for Microsoft cloud environments.

```json
{
  "vault": {
    "type": "azure_key_vault",
    "vault_url": "https://your-keyvault.vault.azure.net/",
    "client_id": "${AZURE_CLIENT_ID}",
    "client_secret": "${AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET}",
    "tenant_id": "${AZURE_TENANT_ID}",
    "sync_interval": "300s"
  }
}
```

## Key Synchronization

### Automatic Sync Process

Bifrost automatically synchronizes keys from your vault at regular intervals:

1. **Discovery**: Scans the configured vault paths for API keys and virtual keys
2. **Validation**: Verifies key format and accessibility
3. **Sync**: Updates Bifrost's internal key store with new and modified keys
4. **Deprecation**: Identifies and archives keys that have been removed from the vault
5. **Notification**: Logs sync status and any issues encountered

### Sync Configuration

Configure synchronization behavior to match your operational requirements:

```json
{
  "vault": {
    "sync_interval": "300s",
    "sync_paths": [
      "bifrost/provider-keys/*",
      "bifrost/virtual-keys/*"
    ],
    "auto_deprecate": true,
    "backup_deprecated_keys": true
  }
}
```

#### Configuration Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `sync_interval` | Time between sync operations | `300s` |
| `sync_paths` | Vault paths to monitor for keys | `["bifrost/*"]` |
| `auto_deprecate` | Automatically deprecate removed keys | `true` |
| `backup_deprecated_keys` | Backup keys before deprecation | `true` |

## Key Management Lifecycle

### Key States

Keys in Bifrost can have the following states:

- **Active**: Currently in use and available for requests
- **Deprecated**: Marked for removal but still functional
- **Archived**: Removed from active use but retained for audit purposes
- **Expired**: Keys that have exceeded their validity period

### Deprecation Process

When keys are removed from the vault:

1. **Detection**: Next sync cycle identifies missing keys
2. **Grace Period**: Keys enter deprecated state with configurable grace period
3. **Notification**: Administrators are notified of pending deprecation
4. **Archive**: Keys are moved to archived state after grace period expires

```json
{
  "vault": {
    "deprecation": {
      "grace_period": "24h",
      "notify_admins": true,
      "retain_archived": "90d"
    }
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Authentication

- **Vault Tokens**: Use time-limited tokens with minimal required permissions
- **IAM Roles**: Leverage cloud provider IAM roles for secure authentication
- **Certificate-based Auth**: Support for mutual TLS authentication where available

### Encryption

- **Transit Encryption**: All communication with vault systems uses TLS
- **At-Rest Encryption**: Keys are encrypted in Bifrost's internal storage
- **Key Rotation**: Automatic detection and handling of rotated vault credentials

### Audit Trail

Complete audit logging for all vault operations:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "operation": "key_sync",
  "vault_type": "hashicorp",
  "keys_synced": 15,
  "keys_deprecated": 2,
  "status": "success"
}
```
