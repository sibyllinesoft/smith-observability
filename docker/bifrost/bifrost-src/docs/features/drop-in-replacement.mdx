## Zero Code Changes

The Bifrost Gateway acts as a drop-in replacement for popular AI SDKs. This means you can point your existing OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google GenAI client to Bifrost's HTTP gateway and instantly gain access to advanced features without rewriting your application.

The magic happens with a single line change: update your `base_url` to point to Bifrost's gateway, and everything else stays exactly the same.

## How It Works

Bifrost provides **100% compatible endpoints** for popular AI SDKs by acting as a protocol adapter. Your existing SDK code continues to work unchanged, but now benefits from Bifrost's multi-provider support, automatic failovers, semantic caching, and governance features.

<Tab title="OpenAI SDK">

```python
# Before: Direct to OpenAI
client = openai.OpenAI(
    api_key="your-openai-key"
)

# After: Through Bifrost
client = openai.OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:8080/openai",  # Only change needed
    api_key="dummy-key"  # Keys handled by Bifrost
)
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Anthropic SDK">

```python
# Before: Direct to Anthropic
client = anthropic.Anthropic(
    api_key="your-anthropic-key"
)

# After: Through Bifrost
client = anthropic.Anthropic(
    base_url="http://localhost:8080/anthropic",  # Only change needed
    api_key="dummy-key"  # Keys handled by Bifrost
)
```

## Instant Advanced Features

Once your SDK points to Bifrost, you automatically get:

- **Multi-provider support** with automatic failovers
- **Load balancing** across multiple API keys
- **Semantic caching** for faster responses
- **Governance controls** for usage monitoring and budgets
- **Request/response logging** and analytics
- **Rate limiting** and circuit breakers

and so much more! All without changing a **single line** of your application logic.
