## What are Integrations?

Integrations are protocol adapters that make Bifrost **100% compatible** with existing AI provider SDKs. They translate between provider-specific API formats (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google GenAI) and Bifrost's unified API, enabling you to:

- **Drop-in replacement** - Change only the base URL in your existing code
- **Zero migration effort** - Keep your current SDK and request/response handling
- **Instant feature access** - Get governance, caching, fallbacks, and monitoring without code changes

## Quick Example

### Before (Direct Provider)
```python
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(
    api_key="your-openai-key"
)
```

### After (Bifrost Integration)
```python
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:8080/openai",  # Point to Bifrost
    api_key="dummy-key"  # Keys handled by Bifrost
)
```

**That's it!** Your application now has automatic fallbacks, governance, monitoring, and all Bifrost features.
