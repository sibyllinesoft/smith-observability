# Prometheus configuration for tracking bifrost-http service (for development and testing purposes only, don't use in production without proper setup)
global:
  scrape_interval: 5s # Scrape every 5 seconds

# Note: Target configuration depends on your deployment environment:
# - For local development: Use "host.docker.internal:8080" to access the service running on your host machine
# - For Docker deployment: Use "bifrost-api:8080" to access the service within the Docker network
#   Make sure to replace "bifrost-api" and "8080" with your actual docker container name and port if different
#   Also check that you have the bifrost container inside "bifrost_tracking_network".

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "bifrost-api"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["host.docker.internal:8080"] # Scrape from the /metrics endpoint
